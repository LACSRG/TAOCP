# TAOCP
Knuth's classic series of volumes, The Art of Computer Programming

This repository holds canonical or exemplary solutions to problems from Knuth's TAOCP.
Of course, we have to start somewhere, so I am seeding this repo with my own solutions.
As more contributions are received, we'll augment or replace existing solutions as
appropriate.

My goal is to include complete solutions for all exercizes of level < 40, including
any designated M or HM.  Of course, it would be swell to include complete solutions
for problems of level >= 40, and some of those will even be publishable, but for these
let's use this space to collaborate on these problems by building on each other's
insights, sketches, and partial solutions.
